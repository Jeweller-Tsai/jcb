# JCB 节操币

## About
This project is for learning Elixir and Phoenix.

In my company, we say "thank you" by giving people a JCB, which is ￥50.
Everyone has 10 JCBs per month. So what this app does is simply -- "A user
can a JCB to another".

## Get started
To start your Phoenix app:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
